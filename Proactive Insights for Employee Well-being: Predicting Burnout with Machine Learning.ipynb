        "# Proactive Insights for Employee Well-being: Predicting Burnout with Machine Learning\n",
        "\n",
        "In this rapidly paced world, we all seem to have a lot to keep up with and even more to do with more multitasking, task-switching and decline in mental health. In this light, World Mental Health Day was established and is celebrated annually on October 10th to raise awareness about mental health issues and mobilize support worldwide.\n",
        "\n",
        "Having moved around a bit in the data space in the past months, you work as a data scientist at NeuroWell Analytics. Last week Friday in the usual weekly stand-ups the Human Resources Manager raised the issue of **employee burnout** as one of the top-most challenges highlighted often by companies NeuroWell Analytics clientele. Upon this discovery, your boss turns towards you and assigns to you the task of addressing this important issue. He decided it would be best to build a solution predicting employee burnout rates using historical data to proactively address mental health concerns.\n",
