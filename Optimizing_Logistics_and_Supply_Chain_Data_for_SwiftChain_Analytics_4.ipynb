        "## Summary Report: Predicting and Reducing Delivery Delays for SwiftChain Analytics\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. Introduction\n",
        "* Briefly restate the problem: predicting delivery delays (late, on-time, early).\n",
        "* Mention the objective: developing a predictive model and providing actionable insights.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Data Overview and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
        "* Briefly describe the dataset used.\n",
        "* Summarize key findings from your EDA (e.g., distribution of delivery statuses, relationships between key variables like shipping mode and delivery status, observations about missing values if any were found and handled).\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Feature Engineering and Selection\n",
        "* Explain the new features you created (e.g., shipping duration, category frequency, country average shipping duration).\n",
        "* Mention that feature selection was performed and the number of top features used for modeling.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. Model Development and Evaluation\n",
        "* List the classification models you trained (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).\n",
        "* Present the evaluation results (Accuracy and F1 Score) for each model.\n",
        "* State which model performed best based on the chosen metric (F1 Score for XGBoost in this case) and was selected for tuning.\n",
        "* Briefly mention the results of hyperparameter tuning and the final performance of the best model.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. Key Feature Importances and Insights\n",
        "* Discuss the most important features identified by the best model (refer to the feature importance analysis).\n",
        "* For each important feature, explain its potential relationship with delivery delays. For example:\n",
        "    * If `shipping_duration` is important, longer durations are likely linked to delays.\n",
        "    * If certain `product_category_id` values are important, perhaps those categories experience more delays.\n",
        "    * If `customer_country` related features are important, there might be country-specific logistics challenges.\n",
        "    * Relate other important features like `order_item_total_amount`, `sales_per_customer`, etc., to potential operational factors influencing delivery.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 6. Actionable Recommendations\n",
        "* Based on the feature importances and your overall analysis, provide specific, actionable recommendations for SwiftChain Analytics to reduce delivery delays. For example:\n",
        "    * **Focus on optimizing logistics for product categories/countries** identified with higher delay associations.\n",
        "    * **Investigate processes related to high `shipping_duration`** orders.\n",
        "    * **Analyze operational workflows** related to features like `order_item_total_amount` or `sales_per_customer` if they are highly influential.\n",
        "    * **Suggest further data collection** if certain factors seem important but are not fully captured in the current data.\n",
        "    * **Recommend implementing the predictive model** to flag potentially delayed orders proactively.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 7. Conclusion\n",
        "* Briefly summarize the project's success in developing a predictive model and generating insights.\n",
        "* Reiterate the potential positive impact of implementing the recommendations.\n",
        "\n",
